### NOTES

1. The tracking agent was working with a flat 50 pixel L2 distance from the center rather than in the dotted box at the center of the task. This means it may not have been clear to the participants when the task was in error. @Szonya, please review the instructions for this task, was it to keep the target in the box? or close to the center?
